# Crypto-Finances-Calculator

This project is a cryptocurrency trading app. Users can practice trading the old fashioned way, "on paper". Users can make trades with as much or as little imaginary money as they want. and log their trades to text files to keep track of their trading history. The app gives the user options to trade in USD, USDT, BTC, ETH, and BNB. The three primary platforms to use for practicing trading with this app are Coinbase, Binance, and Robinhood.
